CockroachDB is a distributed SQL database built on a transactional and strongly-consistent key-value store. It scales horizontally; survives disk, machine, rack, and even datacenter failures with minimal latency disruption and no manual intervention; supports strongly-consistent ACID transactions; and provides a familiar SQL API for structuring, manipulating, and querying data.

CockroachDB uses RocksDB as its storage engine, wich is optimized for fast, low latency storage such as flash drives and high-speed disk drives.

CockroachDB supports the PostgreSQL wire protocol, so it can be used with any available PostgreSQL client drivers to connect from various languages.
