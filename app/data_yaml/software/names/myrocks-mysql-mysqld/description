MyRocks is an open source project that integrates with RocksDB as a new MySQL storage engine. It gives users better read efficiency, better write efficiency, and better space efficiency for better performance on flash storage.

## Key MyRocks features

### Greater Space Efficiency

MyRocks has 2x better compression compared to compressed InnoDB, 3-4x better compression compared to uncompressed InnoDB, meaning you use less space.

### Greater Writing Efficiency

MyRocks has a 10x less write amplification compared to InnoDB, giving you better endurance of flash storage and improving overall throughput.

### Faster Replication

No random reads for updating secondary keys, except for unique indexes. The Read-Free Replication option does away with random reads when updating primary keys, regardless of uniqueness, with a row-based binary logging format.

### Faster Data Loading

MyRocks writes data directly onto the bottommost level, which avoids all compaction overheads when you enable faster data loading for a session.
