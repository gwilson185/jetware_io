### [Startups and web developers](web_developers)

The ready-to-use software stacks and runtime environment constructor allow user to build a professional runtime environment optimized for web applications within one click, without complicated installing and configuring. It is possible to use the same runtime environment for development, testing, and production servers. Jetware simplifies project deployment and operations, increases the speed of development and efficiency of testing, and reduces the cost of server administration.
